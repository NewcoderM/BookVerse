## Site Structure

Storyverse consists of 4 page website with 3 pages that the user can navigate between via the navigation bar. By default, the loading page is the Home page. In addition to being centred, the logo is connected to the home page. Two navigation links, [Home] (index.html) and [Books] (books.html), are located on the left side of the logo. Two more navigation links and [Contact] (contact.html), are located on the right side of the logo.

## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

The Color pallete I use is based on the Dark teal and I use 3 colors for the pallete to introduce the webpage a little more and it also gives the end-user to have passion to read the books.

### Typography

For storyverse we choose the default fonts. Three fonts were tested before but it didn't suits the philosophy.

# Features

Because Storyverse is organised and styled similarly to a standard website, using it is incredibly easy and natural, encouraging users to explore further.

All pages—aside from the home page—have a headline that is easy to see when you first arrive and a brief paragraph that introduces the content. The design, colour scheme, and language employed are meant to be approachable and simple to comprehend.

## Navigation

* Links to the primary material are located in the navigation menu, which is prominently displayed at the top of the page.

* To maintain the best possible user experience, the navigation bar is available in three distinct screen size variations. All three retain the same colour scheme and design elements, with the exception of the structure.

## Home Page

 * The home page is the landing page of the website. It gives the end-user a feel of welcoming.

 * A sizable book image is prominently displayed and was picked for its aesthetic, colour scheme, and tone to complement the website. The site name and a memorable slogan are superimposed over the book image.

 * We have one section for landing page which helps the end user to navigate to the books page.
