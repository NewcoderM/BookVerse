## Site Structure

Storyverse consists of 4 page website with 3 pages that the user can navigate between via the navigation bar. By default, the loading page is the Home page. In addition to being centred, the logo is connected to the home page. Two navigation links, [Home] (index.html) and [Books] (books.html), are located on the left side of the logo. Two more navigation links and [Contact] (contact.html), are located on the right side of the logo.

## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

The Color pallete I use is based on the Dark teal and I use 3 colors for the pallete to introduce the webpage a little more and it also gives the end-user to have passion to read the books.
